// Emulation of NPN_PluginThreadAsyncCall.

// There are versions of Firefox, which have NPN_PluginThreadAsyncCall removed.
// Since it's required by FreshPlayerPlugin, it needs to be emulated.
// Current implementation uses the fact the browser runs GLib's mainloop.

/// Initialize plugin-thread-async-call emulation.
///
/// This call must be performed from plugin's main thread.

/// Schedule |func| on the plugin's main thread.
