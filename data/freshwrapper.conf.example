# Audio buffer is used to continuously provide sound adapter with data.
# Values too low may lead to buffer underruns and stuttering.  Values
# too high will lead to noticeable latency. Usually plugin selects size
# on its own, but you may override bounds here

# lower bound for audio buffer size, in milliseconds
audio_buffer_min_ms = 20

# higher bound of audio buffer size, in milliseconds
